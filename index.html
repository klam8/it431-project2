        <h2>Hi, My name is Keith Lam.</h2>
        <p>As a web developer with a focus on UX/UI design, my work is all about creating user-centered websites and applications that are visually appealing and easy to navigate. 
          I understand the importance of designing interfaces that are intuitive and efficient, while also being aesthetically pleasing. 
          I am skilled in using various tools and technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and design software to bring your ideas to life. 
          I also have a good understanding of user research and testing, which I use to gather insights and feedback to inform my design decisions. 
          My ultimate goal is to create digital experiences that are both functional and enjoyable for the end-user.
